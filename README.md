Hi everyone,

By name is Robb Stark and I also go by the king in the north, why some refer to me as the young wolf. I am the first and eldest son of Eddard Stark (Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North) and Lady Catelyn Stark (Fomerly known as Lady Tully of Riverun). Won my fisrt battle at the age of fourteen at the Whisperen Wood.
